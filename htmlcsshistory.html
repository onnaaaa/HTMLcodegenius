		<h1 class="head">HTML/CSS history</h1>
		<p class="ok">At its inception in 1990, HTML was only intended to provide structure for text-based documents. It had a concept of multiple levels of headings and of body text, but not much else.</p>

		<p class="head">HTML 2.0 was released in April 1994 and approved by the W3C as a standard in September of 1995, and it brought images. Developers were given very little control over how images were displayed. In fact, image tags supported only two attributes: One for the image source (providing a URL than the image could be downloaded from) and one for the alt text (a message to be shown to the user if the image could not be displayed for some reason).</p>

		<p class="ok">HTML 3.0, released in November 1993, added tables. They were only ever intended to be used to present “tabular data”, meaning data that is inherently two-dimensional.</p>

		<p class="head">The intentions of the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization responsible for publishing web standards) were ignored by developers, however. Web site creators quickly adopted tables as a means of control page layout. Indeed, tables provided nearly the same level of control that traditional publishers enjoyed.</p>

		<p class="ok">HTML 3.2, published on May 5, 1996, and recommended as a standard in January 1997, introduced design elements such as fonts, colors, and background elements. This development marked the birth of the modern web designer. Suddenly, web pages were no longer about pure content alone, and presentation became king.</p>

		<p class="head">Browser developers, eager to capitalize on this trend, began introducing their own proprietary formatting tags. The companies behind the browsers saw these tags as a way to lock users in and cement their position in the marked. These browser-specific tags were marketed as improving users’ experience.</p>

		<p class="ok">Some proprietary tags went on to become part of future HTML standards, but many did not. Examples include Netscape’s &lt;blink&gt; tag and Internet Explorer’s &lt;marquee&gt; tag.</p>

		<p class="head">The use of HTML tags to control the appearance of web pages let to a number of problems. Many of the contortions that web developers subjected their pages to in the name of page layout caused accessibility problems for disabled users. Browsers interpreted HTML code differently, causing pages to display differently across environments. Content relying on proprietary tags sometimes didn’t display at all. The latter problem was exacerbated by tags becoming “orphaned” whenever a competing specification won out as a standard, leaving the losing specification behind.</p>

		<p class="ok">The W3C finally conceived of a better way. They would return to the roots of the web by completing divorcing content from its presentation. The process kicked off in December 1996 with the release of the CSS Level 1 Specification.</p>

		<p class="head">CSS was the brainchild of Håkon Wium Lie. Lie then worked with Tim Berners-Lee, creator of HTML, and later went on to become CTO of Opera Software. Lie’s was one of many style sheet proposals made at the time, but his and Bert Bos’ proposals contributed the most to what we now know as CSS.</p>

		<p class="ok">The roots of style sheets go all the way back to SGML, the predecessor of XML that originally inspired HTML. However, none of the existing technologies like DSSSL or FOSI were flexible enough for the dynamic, modular nature of the world wide web. It was the desire to allow a document’s style to span multiple files that led to the cascading nature of CSS, where one style could cascade across multiple sheets.</p>

		<p class="head">The creation and standardization of CSS originally fell under the W3C’s HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB), but it eventually became influential enough that it’s own committee was formed in early 1997, the CSS Working Group, then chaired by Chris Lilley.</p>
