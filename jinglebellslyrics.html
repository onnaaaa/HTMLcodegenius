	<h1><i>Jingle Bells Lyrics</i></h1>
	<p>Dashing through <b>the snow</b> <br>
	In a one-horse open sleigh <br>
	O'er the fields we go <br>
	Laughing all the way<br>
	Bells on bobtails ring<br>
	Making spirits bright<br>
	What fun it is to ride and sing<br>
	A sleighing song tonight, oh!</p>

	<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells
	Jingle all the way <br>
	Oh, what fun it is to ride <br>
	In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!<br>
	Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
	Jingle all the way<br>
	Oh what fun it is to ride<br>
	In a one-horse open sleigh</p>

	<p>Now the ground is white<br>
	Go it while you're young<br>
	Take the girls tonight<br>
	Sing this sleighing song<br>
	Get a bobtailed bay<br>
	Two forty for his speed<br>
	And hitch him to an open sleigh<br>
	And you will take the lead</p>

	<p>Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
	Jingle all the way<br>
	Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
	In a one-horse <b>open sleigh</b>, hey!<br>
	Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
	Jingle all the way<br>
	Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
	In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
	Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
	<i>In one horse open sleigh!</i></p>
